Differential testing
--------------------

Single tests per gene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How to perform likelihood-ratio tests `lrt <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/single/likelihood_ratio_test.ipynb>`__.

How to perform Wald tests for a single parameter `wald <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/single/wald_test.ipynb>`__.

How to perform Wald tests for multiple parameters `multiparameter wald <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/single/wald_test_multiple_effects.ipynb>`__.

How to perform t-tests `t_test <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/single/t_test.ipynb>`__.

How to perform Wilcoxon tests `wilcoxon <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/single/wilcoxon_test.ipynb>`__.

How to perform tests with continuous covariates such as time, pseudotime or space `continuous test <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/single/continuous_wald.ipynb>`__.

Map single tests across partitions of data set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set up a test and conduct test for each gene in each cluster or each sample etc.
We show an example for doing this for a t-test in `partition <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/single/run_by_partition.ipynb>`__.
   
Multiple tests per gene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How to perform pairwise tests `pairwise <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/multi/pairwise.ipynb>`__.

How to perform group versus rest tests `versus_rest <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/test/multiversus_rest.ipynb>`__.


Gene set enrichment: enrich
---------------------------

How to conduct a gene set enrichment workflow `enrich <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/enrich/enrich.ipynb>`__.


Integration with other packages
-------------------------------

How to integrate with `scanpy <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/diffxpy_tutorials/tree/master/diffxpy_tutorials/integration/scanpy_integration.ipynb>`__.


Example work-flows on real data sets
------------------------------------

Will be added soon.
